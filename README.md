## Planning

#### Wireframe

The wireframe was a preliminary plan of the page. During the edits, some areas of the page were tweaked.

#### User Stories

Some user stories for this project:

- As a user, I want to see a list of all the driverâ€™s standing in the current season and how many points they are at
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a specific season to view additional details about the summary of the races (winner, circuit, date, etc)
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a specific race for a season to view additional details about the final result of the race (finishing orders of the race)
- As a user, I want to be able to view the page on mobile phone and a desktop to quickly see the results of the sport

## About

Thank you for stopping by!

My name is Kenny and I'm an aspiring software engineer currently studying in General Assembly's full-time software engineering program. I enjoy watching all F1 related things and the idea of building this app came when I was going through Wikipedia pages to see historical results of races from previous seasons and thought to myself there could be an easier way.

## Unsolved problems

Some unsolved problems include spacing of the cards for the current standing on the front page.
Some future addition ideas include implementing a circuits page to show all circuits F1 has raced on, including some basic information and implementation of Google Maps API to show its location.
